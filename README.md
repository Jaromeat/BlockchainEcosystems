# Exploring Blockchain Ecosystems

## Abstract

We explored Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Tezos as smart contract ecosystems to determine their strengths and weaknesses based on popularity, features, development tools, and future. We then explain our experience designing and developing a contract for each ecosystem. Then we looked at two up and coming ecosystems to determine where the future of cryptocurrency is headed. We discovered that blockchain ecosystems are moving away from proof of work towards proof of stake and other alternatives to ensure blockchain ecosystems remain scalable, fast, and secure.
